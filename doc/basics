Given an ADT such as,
```scala
sealed trait Tree[+T]
case class Branch[+T](left: Tree[T], right: Tree[T]) extends Tree[T]
case class Leaf[+T](value: T) extends Tree[T]
```
and provided an implicit instance of `Show[Int]` is in scope, and a Magnolia
derivation for the `Show` typeclass has been provided, we can
automatically derive an implicit typeclass instance of `Show[Tree[Int]]`
on-demand, like so,
```scala
Branch(Branch(Leaf(1), Leaf(2)), Leaf(3)).show
```
Typeclass authors may provide Magnolia derivations in the Typeclass's companion
object, but it is easy to create your own.

The derivation typeclass for a `Show` typeclass might look like this:
```scala
import language.experimental.macros, magnolia._

object ShowDerivation {
  type Typeclass[T] = Show[T]
  
  def join[T](ctx: CaseClass[Show, T]): Show[T] = new Show[T] {
    def show(value: T): String = ctx.parameters.map { p =>
      s"${p.label}=${p.typeclass.show(p.dereference(value))}"
    }.mkString("{", ",", "}")
  }

  def split[T](ctx: SealedTrait[Show, T]): Show[T] =
    new Show[T] {
      def show(value: T): String = ctx.split(value) { sub =>
        sub.typeclass.show(sub.cast(value))
      }
    }

  implicit def gen[T]: Show[T] = macro Magnolia.gen[T]
}
```

The `gen` method will attempt to construct a typeclass for the type passed to
it. Importing `ShowDerivation.gen` from the example above will make generic
derivation for `Show` typeclasses available in the scope of the import. The
`macro Magnolia.gen[T]` binding must be made in a static object, and the type
constructor, `Typeclass`, and the methods `join` and `split` must be
defined in the same object.

If you control the typeclass you are deriving for, the companion object of the
typeclass makes a good choice for providing the implicit derivation methods
described above.

## Debugging

Deriving typeclasses is not always guaranteed to succeed, though. Many
datatypes are complex and deeply-nested, and failure to derive a typeclass for
a single parameter in one of the leaf nodes will cause the entire tree to fail.

Magnolia tries to be informative about why failures occur, by providing a
"stack trace" showing the path to the type which could not be derived.

For example, when attempting to derive a `Show` instance for `Entity`, given
the following hypothetical datatypes,

```scala
sealed trait Entity
case class Person(name: String, address: Address) extends Entity
case class Organization(name: String, contacts: Set[Person]) extends Entity
case class Address(lines: List[String], country: Country)
case class Country(name: String, code: String, salesTax: Boolean)
```
the absence, for example, of a `Show[Boolean]` typeclass instance would cause
derivation to fail, but the reason might not be obvious, so instead, Magnolia
will report the following compile error:

```scala
could not derive Show instance for type Boolean
    in parameter 'salesTax' of product type Country
    in parameter 'country' of product type Address
    in parameter 'address' of product type Person
    in chained implicit of type Set[Person]
    in parameter 'contacts' of product type Organization
    in coproduct type Entity
```

This "derivation stack trace" will only be displayed when invoking a derivation
method, e.g. `Show.gen[Entity]`, directly. When the method is invoked through
implicit search, to reduce spurious error messages (when Magnolia's derivation
fails, but implicit search still finds a valid implicit) the errors are not
shown.
